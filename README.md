# Image Processing Assignment 2

This repository contains Python implementations for two fundamental image processing operations based on the following assignment questions:

## Assignment Questions

### Question 1: Otsu's Algorithm
**Consider an image with 2 objects and a total of 3-pixel values (1 for each object and one for the background). Add Gaussian noise to the image. Implement and test Otsu's algorithm with this image.**

### Question 2: Region Growing Segmentation  
**Implement a region-growing technique for image segmentation. The basic idea is to start from a set of points inside the object of interest (foreground), denoted as seeds, and recursively add neighboring pixels as long as they are in a pre-defined range of the pixel values of the seeds.**

## Overview

### Question 1: Otsu's Algorithm Implementation
Uses `input_image_q1.jpg`, adds Gaussian noise, and implements Otsu's automatic thresholding algorithm from scratch.

**Features:**
- Loads actual input image (input_image_q1.jpg)
- Gaussian noise addition with configurable parameters
- Complete Otsu's algorithm implementation from scratch
- Comparison with OpenCV's built-in Otsu method
- Comprehensive visualization showing original, noisy, and thresholded images
- Statistical analysis and accuracy comparison

### Question 2: Region Growing Implementation
Uses `input_image_q2.jpg` and implements a region growing technique for image segmentation that starts from seed points and recursively adds neighboring pixels within a predefined intensity range.

**Features:**
- Loads actual input image (input_image_q2.jpg)
- 8-connected neighborhood consideration
- Multiple seed point support with different region labels
- Configurable threshold parameter testing
- Queue-based efficient implementation
- Comprehensive analysis of different threshold effects

## Algorithm Details

### Question 1: Otsu's Algorithm Implementation

The implementation follows these steps:

1. **Input Processing**: Loads `input_image_q1.jpg` and preprocesses it for Otsu's algorithm
2. **Noise Addition**: Adds Gaussian noise (mean=0, std=10) to make thresholding more challenging
3. **Otsu's Method Implementation**:
   - Calculates histogram of the noisy image
   - Iterates through all possible threshold values (1-255)
   - For each threshold:
     - Calculates background and foreground weights
     - Computes class means and variances
     - Calculates between-class variance
   - Selects threshold with maximum between-class variance
4. **Validation**: Compares results with OpenCV's built-in Otsu implementation

**Key Functions:**
- `preprocess_image_for_otsu()`: Image preprocessing
- `add_gaussian_noise()`: Gaussian noise addition
- `otsu_threshold()`: Core Otsu algorithm implementation
- `calculate_histogram()`: Histogram computation
- `apply_threshold()`: Binary thresholding

### Question 2: Region Growing Implementation

The implementation follows these steps:

1. **Input Processing**: Loads `input_image_q2.jpg` for segmentation
2. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Initialize with strategically placed seed point(s)
   - Add seed to queue and mark as visited
   - While queue is not empty:
     - Remove pixel from queue
     - Check if pixel intensity is within threshold of seed value
     - If yes, add to region and add unvisited neighbors to queue
     - Continue until queue is empty
3. **Multi-threshold Analysis**: Tests different threshold values (5, 15, 30)
4. **Visualization**: Creates comprehensive results showing segmentation effects

**Key Features:**
- 8-connected neighborhood (considers all 8 surrounding pixels)
- Multiple seed support for multi-region segmentation
- Configurable threshold parameter
- Efficient queue-based BFS implementation
- Region statistics and coverage analysis

**Key Classes and Functions:**
- `RegionGrowing` class: Main implementation with threshold management
- `region_grow()`: Single seed region growing algorithm
- `multi_seed_region_grow()`: Multiple seed support with different labels
- `get_neighbors()`: 8-connected neighborhood function
